Line Mover
==========

A simple plugin that allows moving the currently selected lines up and down
using `Ctrl`+`↑` and `Ctrl`+`↓`.

This is derived from [a plugin] [0] that featured more functionality (deleting
and copying lines for instance), but was written for Gedit 2 and has not been
updated by now.


Installation
------------

To install this plugin, clone the repository either directly into or copy the
files to

  * `~/.local/share/gedit/plugins` or
  * `/usr/local/share/gedit/plugins`.


TODO
----

- [ ] Make keyboard shortcuts configurable (especially since they silently
      override).
