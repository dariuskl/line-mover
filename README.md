Line Mover
==========

A simple plugin that allows moving lines up and down using `[Ctrl]`+`[↑]` and
`[Ctrl]`+`[↓]`.

This is derived from a plugin [0] that featured more functionality, but was
written for Gedit 2 and has not been updated by now.

TODO
----

- [ ] Make keyboard shortcuts configurable (especially since they silently
      override).
